      <h2>About Berserk</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Berserk</b> (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written
        and illustrated by <b>Kentaro Miura</b>. Set in a medieval Europe–inspired dark fantasy world,
        the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a
        mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". The series follows Guts' journey seeking revenge
        on Griffith, who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a powerful demonic being.
      </p>

        Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in
        Hakusensha's manga magazine <b>Monthly Animal House</b> [ja], which was replaced in 1992 by the
        semimonthly magazine <b>Young Animal</b>, where Berserk has continued its publication. Following
        Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter that he worked on was published posthumously in
        September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under the supervision of Miura's
        fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori [ja] along with Miura's assistants from
        Studio Gaga.
