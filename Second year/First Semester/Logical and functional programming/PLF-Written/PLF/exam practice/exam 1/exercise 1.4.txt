f([], []).

f([H|T], S):- H mod 2 =:= 0, f(T, S).

% the results are:
% L = [1, 2, 3]
% L = [1, 3]
% false

% Because at first it goes only on the second branch 
% (and on the first branch when the list is empty), 
% thus reconstructing the initial list, so L=[1,2,3]. 
% Then it backtracks and tries 
% the third branch, which succeeds only when H is even, 
% namely when it is called as f([2, 3], L). This returns L=[1, 3].
% Then it tries to backtrack even further, but the third branch fails 
% every time, so it returns false.
