A server collects data from multiple clients in the form of integer numbers.

The server has an internal value where it adds all the data colected from the clients.

The server will only colect data if a minimum number of clients are conected.

Each client sends 2 types of data to the server, an even number and an odd number, depending on the type of data the server requests.

Each client sends data to the server once every 2 seconds.

The data colection process has 3 states:
1) standby - the server wait for the required number of clients to connect
2) even - the server is demanding even numbers
3) odd - the server is demandig odd numbers

The serev will announce the current state of the data colection process via broadcast.

Each client has an even and an odd number to sent to the server, each randomly generated, with a value between 1 and 9.

When the server is collecting data it will switch between requesting even or odd data once every 100 datas colected.

The server will stop collecting data once it colected a total amount of over 9000.
