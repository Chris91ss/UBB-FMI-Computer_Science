# Assignment 01

## Requirements
- Solve one problem statement from each set
- Write the solution to each problem statement in its corresponding Python module (`p1.py`, `p2.py` and `p3.py` respectively).
- Use functions, input parameters and return values
- Each function only does one thing!
- Do not use global variables
- Provide the user relevant messages regarding expected input and the meaning of the program’s output.
- Assignment should be **completed by week 2, hard deadline is week 3**.

## Problem Statements
### First Set
2. Given natural number `n`, determine the prime numbers `p1` and `p2` such that `n = p1 + p2` (check the Goldbach hypothesis).

### Second Set
9. Consider a given natural number `n`. Determine the product `p` of all the proper factors of `n`.

### Third Set
15. Generate the largest perfect number smaller than a given natural number `n`. If such a number does not exist, a message should be displayed. A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, except itself. (e.g.  `6 is a perfect number, as 6=1+2+3`).
