# :computer: Assignment 04 - Problem Solving Methods

## Requirements
- You will have to solve two problem statements from the list below, one using the **backtracking** programming method and one using the **dynamic programming** method.
- For the backtracking problem, implement both an iterative as well as a recursive algorithm (**deadline is week 5**).
- For the dynamic programming problem, implement both the naive, non-optimized version as well as the dynamic programming version (**deadline is week 6**). 
- For the dynamic programming implementation, display the data structure used to memorize the intermediate results and be able to explain how it works. 
- For all implementations understand and be able to explain the computational complexity with regards to runtime.

## Problem Statements
### Backtracking
13. The sequence a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> of distinct integer numbers is given. Display all subsets with a mountain aspect. A set has a mountain aspect if the elements increase up to a point and then they decrease. E.g. `10, 16, 27, 18, 14, 7`.

### Dynamic Programming
1. Determine the longest common subsequence of two given sequences. Subsequence elements are not required to occupy consecutive positions. For example, if `X = "MNPNQMN"` and `Y = "NQPMNM"`, the longest common subsequence has length `4`, and can be one of `"NQMN"`, `"NPMN"` or `"NPNM"`. Determine and display both the length of the longest common subsequence as well as at least one such subsequence.
